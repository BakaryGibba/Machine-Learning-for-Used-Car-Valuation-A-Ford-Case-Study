🚗 **Predicting Used Car Prices: A Machine Learning Journey** 🚀  

I’m thrilled to share my latest project where I dove into the world of **data science** and **machine learning** to build a predictive model for **used car prices**! 🛠️💡  

Using a dataset of **Ford car sales**, I tackled the challenge of predicting the optimal price for used cars. Here’s a glimpse of what I accomplished:  

🔹 **Data Cleaning & EDA**:  
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure data quality.  
- Explored the dataset to uncover insights, such as the distribution of cars by fuel type and the impact of transmission types on price outliers.  

🔹 **Feature Engineering**:  
- Identified the top 5 features most correlated with car prices.  
- Transformed the data using **second-degree polynomial features** to capture non-linear relationships.  

🔹 **Model Building & Evaluation**:  
- Built and compared **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, and **Ridge Regression** models.  
- Performed **Grid Search with 4-fold cross-validation** to find the optimal hyperparameters for Ridge Regression.  
- Achieved an impressive **R² score of 0.86** and minimized the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to ensure accurate predictions.  

🔹 **Key Insights**:  
- Discovered that features like **engine size**, **year**, and **mileage** have the strongest impact on car prices.  
- Visualized correlations and outliers to better understand the data.  

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply **machine learning techniques** to a real-world problem and deliver actionable insights. It reinforced my skills in **data preprocessing**, **model selection**, and **hyperparameter tuning**, while also highlighting the importance of **exploratory data analysis** in driving decision-making.  

I’m excited to continue exploring the intersection of data science and business solutions. If you’re interested in the details or want to discuss how machine learning can solve your business challenges, feel free to reach out! Let’s connect and innovate together. 🌟
